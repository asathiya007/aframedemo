In January 2020, I joined the Augmented Reality Experiences VIP (Vertically Integrated Project) at Georgia Tech. This is a practice project I worked on to better understand A-Frame and AR on the web. 

It features a box and a 3D model of Buzz, Georgia Tech's mascot, over a camera view. Box entities can be moved in space, using on-screen button presses and key presses/holds. 

It also features a collision detection component. 

Try it out with the following command: 
$ npm install && npm start
